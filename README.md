# API & SOLID

A RESTful CRUD API for managing users, built in pure PHP 8.4 with no frameworks. Follows SOLID principles, uses an in-memory mock data store, and is designed for local development with XAMPP (Apache and mod_php). Features clean architecture, PSR-4 autoloading, and JSON-based endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting users.
